            <h3>Abandoned</h3>
            <p>You feel discarded and pushed off to one side. This may be the case especially if
                your ex-spouse seems to be moving along with his or her life just fine or is already
                involved in another relationship.</p>

            <h3>Afraid</h3>
            <p>You’re scared of what life will be like now. You may be fearful about your ability to
                cope emotionally, or you may be uncertain about practical concerns such as
                money, raising the children, or where you’ll live.</p>

            <h3>Ambivalent</h3>
            <p>You’re not sure how you feel about this whole thing. The divorce may even be your
                idea, or you may think that your spouse is right in seeking a separation.</p>
                <input type="radio" name="feeling" value="Yes" id="yesOption">

            <h3>Angry</h3>
            <p>Anger often feels like a physical thing. Your muscles tense up and you may feel like
                yelling at someone or hitting something. Your anger is most likely directed toward
                your ex-spouse, or you may find yourself getting angry at other people, or even
                yourself.</p>
                <input type="radio" name="feeling" value="Yes" id="yesOption">

            <h3>Anxious</h3>
            <p>Anxiety is distinct from fear and is often a generalized feeling. If you’re afraid, at least
                you know what scares you. If you’re anxious, on the other hand, you’re likely to feel
                agitated without knowing exactly why. You may experience cold sweats,
                hyperactivity, or edginess.</p>
                <input type="radio" name="feeling" value="Yes" id="yesOption">

        <div class="card" data-feeling="Ashamed">
            
            <h3>Ashamed</h3>
            <p>You may feel that this divorce is a reflection on you, and you therefore experience a
                sense of personal failure or a fear that others will see it that way. Or you may feel a
                sense of shame when you tell others about your separation or they ask about it.
                Shame has a great deal to do with your self-esteem, but even people with the
                healthiest self-regard can feel ashamed when it comes to divorce.</p>

            <h3>Bitter</h3>
            <p>You feel cheated by your ex-spouse and perhaps by others in your life. You may feel
                jealous and resentful toward others, and generally feel like a victim.</p>

            <h3>Concerned
                about legal issues</h3>
            <p>You have significant concerns or questions about the legal process, your rights, what
                to expect from the divorce process, or how to best approach the legal and divorce
                issues ahead.</p>

            <h3>Concerned about new relationships</h3>
            <p>You’re concerned and perhaps confused about forming new relationships. Perhaps
                you’re scared of another relationship failure, of making a commitment, or of the
                effects on your children.</p>

            <h3>Concerned about the relationship with your ex</h3>
            <p>There may be many circumstances that require a continued relationship with your
                ex-spouse, from children your ex-spouse to a genuine desire to maintain a
                relationship. You may feel unsure about what you want, how to proceed, or how to
                deal with your ex-spouse.</p>

            <p>Whether they’re minors or adults, you’re not sure how your children will respond to
                your separation and divorce.</p>

            <h3>Confused</h3>
            <p>You may be unsure of what you’re feeling, or your feelings may change quickly. Your
                thoughts may be unfocused and it may be difficult to concentrate, or you may have
                a hard time knowing what to do and how to make good decisions.</p>

            <h3>Depressed</h3>
            <p>Depression can manifest itself as a general mood of melancholy or as a full-blown
                experience that is all-encompassing and seems to have no end. In a major
                depression, your mood, appetite, sleep, memory, and ability to concentrate are
                seriously impaired. You may feel the impulse to do self-destructive things in an effort
                to find relief.</p>

            <h3>Guilty</h3>
            <p>You find yourself feeling guilty, perhaps because the divorce is your choice or
                because you feel as though you’ve hurt or let down your ex-spouse or other family
                members. You might also feel that you could have made more of a go of it.</p>

            <h3>Helpless</h3>
            <p>Things seem to be out of your control. You may be feeling as though you’re on a
                roller-coaster ride that you can’t get off, that you can’t cope with the practicalities
                of your everyday life, and that you are unable to control or manage your feelings.</p>

            <h3>Hostile</h3>
            <p>Your anger and resentment toward your ex-spouse are leading you to feel hostile—
                as though you want to engage in battle, whether in the courtroom or elsewhere.</p>

                spouse or a smarter person, this would never have happened. You feel as though
                you’re not good enough.</p>
